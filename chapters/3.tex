\section{The OAuth 2.0 specification}
OAuth is an authorization framework that implements token-based authentication.
In the context of OAuth, it is necessary to clarify the difference between authentication and authorization.
Authorization is the process of determining whether an entity can access a resource.
Authentication on the other hand aims to identify an entity.
Authentication is a prerequisite for authorization, as an entity has to be securely identified for access control to be relevant \citep{kim_authentication_2017}.

Version 1.0 of the specification was released in 2010 \citep{hammer-lahav_oauth_2010}, and the current latest version, 2.0, was released in 2012 \citep{hardt_oauth_2012}.
As version 1.0 of the spec is obsolete, this thesis will only consider OAuth 2.0.
This section gives an overview of the specification, describing the different roles and identifiers as well as different grant types, with a focus on the authorization code grant.
The OAuth specification defines four separate flows: the authorization code grant and implicit grant that are used to get a new access token, the refresh flow that is used to refresh an existing access token and the introspection request which is used to get information about an existing access token.
