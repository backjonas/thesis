\section{Vulnerabilities in OAuth systems}
\label{sec:vulnerabilities}

The OAuth protocol does not strictly define how systems utilizing the protocol should be implemented, requiring developers to thoroughly consider the security of their implementation choices.
When inspecting the security of OAuth systems, the critical components are the client and the authorization server.
Poorly implemented OAuth systems are very common, with Philippaerts et al. (2022) finding some vulnerability in each inspected authorization server \citep{philippaerts_oauch_2022}.
Client implementations are not any more secure, with Yang et al. (2016) finding simple mistakes in a majority of inspected web applications \citep{yang_model-based_2016}.
As these vulnerabilities are obvious enough to be found with automated methods, an attacker is very likely to find them as well.
