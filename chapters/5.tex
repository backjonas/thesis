\section{Implementing an OAuth client}
\label{sec:implementation}
This chapter describes a practical implementation for an OAuth 2.0 client using an authorization server provided by a third party.
The central design choices are described in addition to their effect on the security of the system.
The OAuth client consists of a minimal frontend application that interacts with an API backend which handles all communication with the authorization server.
The backend supports using multiple authorization servers simultaneously, with the example implementing authorization using Google and Microsoft accounts.
The focus of the chapter lies on the authorization code flow, as the process of retrieving an access token is the most critical part of an OAuth system.
It should also be possible to implement the authorization code flow in a similar way as in the example for a wide variety of different applications.
The chapter briefly describes token introspection and token refreshing, but as their implementation will vary greatly between different applications, they are not described in detail.
The complete source code for the client can be found on GitHub \citep{noauthor_backjonasoauth-client_nodate}.
